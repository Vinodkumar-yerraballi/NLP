# About The data
**Once we take the data to analzed the data and which columns useful or not after that we remove not usefull columns and then we do the data prerprocessing steps**


**This is NLP Classification Problem once we remove the data and take l lakh sample as a subdataset because it's to large dataset**

# Process
**We split the data into tokenes and then we remove all the stopwords in the sample data set afte we stemmeing process and finally lemmantization also we applied to the sample questions and then we create one function to do all work and apply to the small data question_text.columns**

# Machine Learning
**Then we get clean and unknown words ,root words all are removed the we covert the text into vectos using the count vectors and divided the data into train and test dataset. Then it's ready for machine Learning Modeling. We define a function which is runs to the all machine learning models.We use Logistic,Decisiontree,Random,XGB all calsifier algorihms used. All classification algorithms give 94% accuracy score to the model. This is best model with good accuracy score**
