0,An overall good premium experience,"SUMMERY: As a first time iPhone user, I would say one should definitely buy iPhone ONLY for premium built & premium hardware (will talk later) while the whole iOS experience is pretty overrated. iPhones isn't any exceptionally fast with normal apps like YouTube, Insta etc, Android phones are equally snappy with them in 2022.PROS:1. Impressive hardware, the heptics, the autobrightness & otherwise highly ignored things in Android are way too perfectly executed in iPhone and it DOES make a big difference in user experience!!2. The screen is AMAZING.. it doesn't have 90 or 120 hz refresh rate but it FEELS better than my Nord with 90 hz!!3. A14 bionic promises years of performance ahead.4. Battery life is somewhere in between good & great.5.6. The dimensions of phone, it's smaller than usual android phones and feels much more handy along with less weight.7. Overall build quality is great.8. Best audio output out there.9. Long term support.CONS:1. SLOW CHARGING. 20 W only, you'll be jealous of 1/3rd price phones with 60 W charging. Yes that much high charging will effect health of battery but 20 W is way way too less, if Apple is such a legendary company they should have created a battery that can withstand decently fast charging while instead they just use slow charging to keep their battery's health.2. Overy exhagerated software experience, reality is that Android is more user friendly with better gesture & commonsense options & settings & steps to do simple things. iOS looks pretty yes but UX engineers at Apple have really done a crappy job.. there's still no notification grouping in correct manner (its executed poorly), no proper homescreen customisation & just so so so many ""commonsense"" things are missing from iOS I can rant all day about it. Everything you can do in Android with a single click or swipe takes 2 swipes and then a click to do in iOS its SOOOOO ANNOYING. Like you want to clear a notification? Swipe and then click on clear. You want to open a notification? Swipe FIRST and then click open.. like wth????????3. DON'T believe Apple fanboys who scream about speed, Android phones are equally snappy in performance today. There are split second app loading times in iOS also, just like in Android. And yeah iOS DOES HAVE occasional bugs too, apps taking too much time sometimes etc etc.4. FaceID is nice but an in-fingerprint reader seems the best ID to me atleast, that's missing.5. Ridiculously expensive accessories6. Battery life is above good but not great.In the end I would say iPhone, overall, does provide a better experience (mostly cuz of hardware only) but it's expensive. Do know that you're NOT buying a value-for-money phone at all, so buy it only if you can afford it without much difficulty.

1,First step into the ecosystem!,"I have been a smartphone user since 2015, used both windows and android, finally into iOS too. Bought it on Sep 26, 2022.Btw, on the left side on the body, near the screen, the paint had been chipped off (microscopic level). Had complained to the Amazon customer service, but of no avail. 6 months later...........1.  The Externals:  Build Quality: Apart from the earlier niggle, a well put together phone. The familiar glass sandwich design. It is pretty light to hold and because of the squared design, feels really comfortable to hold. I'm not a fan of big phones, so this size is a perfect sweet spot. The buttons also feel really tactile, no wobbles whatsoever. The alert slider is really a blessing! a real convenient thing to have. I guess every manufacturer apart from Oneplus has to implement this.  And then, the IP68. I haven't got a chance to take underwater photos, so yeah, It's a safe thing!  Screen: It is a beautiful display to watch on. Supports HDR and Dolby vision as well. Inky blacks and punchy colors: a treat for movie lovers!. ( Btw, I dont like to watch movies on phones)  Speakers: Dual front firing speakers. Loud, clear. No distortion even at high volumes. Doesn't have much of a bass but a really enjoyable one. Calls are crystal clear if there isn't any signal interference.  Cameras: It takes good quality photos with the rear as well as front cameras. In daylight, the photos look rich and crisp, details are really spot on, the colors look really natural, skin tones produced are natural. Night time photos too look really good. Night mode does make a difference. Considering it's a flagship from 2020, these things are really expected and it does deliver. I really don't have anything to comment about the video, It's splendid!.... just that.2. The Internals.  Battery life: Still at 100% health(not a real thing to worry about, but just saying). On iOS 15, it used to be stellar, I usually get about 5.30 hrs at 50% battery and still there'll be about another 50% to spare. But on iOS 16, I only get about half the battery I used to get on iOS 15. (About 5-6 hours at 100% usage). I really hope this would change in the future with the upcoming updates, but at present, I'm not happy about it.  iOS & Performance : The A14 bionic is a beast. Apps open up in a jiffy. Not much of a gamer, but the games do play without a hint of lag. iOS is a fresh experience for me. But then there are many ""must have"" things that I miss here that I used in Android, like call recording(it's a must have feature, you never know when it'll be a life saver!), The performance and the overall fluidity of the system took a hit when I updated to iOS 16, but slowly, it's getting better over time with updates, (now on iOS 16.4) But, much more refinements to be done, a lot of bugs to be fixed!Some general things : 5G is working fine. Getting good speeds just like the carriers advertised, signal reception is good. Heats up a bit (Culprit- iOS 16, haven't noticed on iOS 15)

3,Worth the price,"I migrated to iOS after using Android for more than 8 years. I am a standard mobile user, I do not play games on my phone and neither do I keep browsing social media for ages. The only things that I use my phone are for calling, whatsapp, taking notes, some light photography and watching videos. The most heavily used activity on my phone is watching videos on youtube.With all these activities being done, my weekly average screen on time is 2-3 hours. I am satisfied with the battery life. It has been around 3 months of usage and the battery capacity is still 100%.  With heavy usage, the phone lasts 6 hours give or take a few minutes, and with medium usage this goes way higher.The standby time is excellent on this device. I have had instances where I used my phone for a total of 2-3 hours but a single charge lasted more than 36 hours.All in all, I can confidently say that I am very happy with the security features the phone offers and I am happy with my purchase.

22,iPhone is the standard against which all smartphones are compared,"I purchased this phone for my wife. Last year I purchased iPhone X for my son who is currently in the UK. I own an iPad and iMac 27"". I am not going to buy an iPhone for myself - at least not yet. One of the main things that I don't like about Android phones is the crap (bloatware) that each maker puts in. Moto and Google Pixel come with pure stock Android. So those can be left out. So I wanted a good phone for my wife so that she could FaceTime with my son in the UK anytime.What is there to say? So many have written about it. Since everyone writes all the positives, I will write some negatives. While there aren't too many, no product can be perfect:1. Brings in all the junk from the old phone. If one is switching from Android to iPhone, the ""Move to iOS"" app on Android can help. However be sure to clean up your Android phone first else all junk (especially ""Good Morning"", ""Good day"" picture crap from WhatsApp photos). Be sure to clean the SMS inbox also, especially all those blocked and spam messages which may be hidden from the main view and we never know that exist.2. WhatsApp cannot be synced. Yes, there are 3rd party apps but they are full of ad-crap and I can't trust them for security.3. Difficulty in validating iMessage and FaceTime. I could not activate iMessage and FaceTime with my mobile number. I simply could not figure this out. This is the case with my Vodaphone SIM/Number in India. Only when I added my email to my Apple ID, the two apps started working. Even now, the mobile number is not verified.4. I wish Apple provides dual SIM. Now dual SIM is almost a necessity. But as my wife does not use two SIMs, for her, it is fine.5. Apple is providing USB-C to lightning cable. They should supply USB-A to lightning cable instead. 99% of the chargers have a USB-A output. I had to purchase a USB-A to USB-C mini adapter (‚Çπ180) for this, or someone may have to buy a cable of the type (good cables from Apple, Belkin, Anker cost ‚Çπ1100 and above). By far, this is my biggest grouse.6. This is not the latest iPhone. The iPhone 13 was ‚Çπ73,000 and did not seem VFM. Even at ‚Çπ56,000 (‚Çπ55,900 to be exact), the iPhone12 may not be money best spent. This is one reason, why I haven't purchased an iPhone for myself all this while (I can afford to buy the latest one every year).

27,Confused? Read on! One stop review for your flagship purchase.,"I went through a lot of reviews and articles before I decided on the iPhone 12. I‚Äôve been an Android user all my life and frankly thought Apple phones were really overpriced(at least here in India). But in the present day, the flagship Android options are no less expensive. If you spend a lot of time on your mobile, using it as your primary camera, social media device, business emails/collaboration and also to stream videos then you definitely need to spend a little more and go with a flagship option for the best experience.Coming to the flagships today (Aug2021),  apart from the iPhone we have Samsung Galaxy S21/+/ultra, Oneplus 9 pro, Vivo x60 pro+, mi 11ultra.  If you read a few reviews you‚Äôll understand that 888Snapdragon has a lot of heating issues  and 9pro cameras didn‚Äôt live up to the hype(also overheating when the camera is in use). Samsung in India ships the phone with exynos2100 which is way less powerful than 888. The prices of all these phones are in the same range (except the ultra). Imp note: iOS updates are across iPhone devices unlike the android updates.Apple has really done a lot of things right on the iPhone12:1. They changed its display from lcd to led (huge value jump)2. A14 Bionic chip is a really fast and smooth without any lag3. Huge improvement on the primary cameras. Still the best video recording phone in the market and the photos are top quality4. The change is the body design is really comfortable in the hand5. The haptics are spot onWhat‚Äôs Missing: (Minor misses though)1. The Notch. Really wish they get rid of the notch but looks like it wont be out until 2023. Anyway you‚Äôll get used to it.2. USB type C charging. The iPad Pro 2020 model onwards already comes with the TypeC usb charging. I guess the iPhone 13 would get this change3. Fingerprint Sensor: Yes. Apple had done away with it couple of years back but with the pandemic still on, you sometimes wish there was a fingerprint sensorWait for the iPhone 13 or go with the 12:It took a while for 12‚Äôs prices to fall.  If you‚Äôre willing to wait till Feb-March 2022 for a good deal then wait for the 13. If you want to change it now, go with the 12.64GB or 128GB:The difference is around ‚Çπ6000.  64GB if you don‚Äôt play too many games and keep dumping the media files every once in while to your pc/storage . Else, the 128üòäBattery:I was indeed very surprised with the battery life. Charging time is a little slower compared to  it‚Äôs competition but the back up is impressive. It easily lasts a day.Android Flagship Option:The truth is, right now is not a good time to purchase an android flagship. If you really want to buy an android flagship, do wait for a while. 895 snapdragon phones are expected to be out by end of the year or early 2022.Hope this review helped :)Update:13 gets a better cam sensor, a15 bionic, 10% bigger battery and a slightly smaller notch. That‚Äôs it. No more differences. Everything else remains the same.iPhone 13 launched at 80k which is lesser than 12‚Äôs launch price(86k).  If you want to save on some cash , 12 will still  do the job (12 is currently around 55k-62k).  However if you can spend that extra 20k, then 13 should be your pick.Planning on taking an Android? Definitely wait until early 2022.

37,Not Really worth the money,"I have been an android user for the past 8+ years. Recently was using iphone 6 for the past few months, liked it much and wanted to switch to ios. I did not want to regret, so i purchased the best in the market, going with iphone 12. Honestly, I dont feel its worthy. Perfomance wise, its good. A lot other phones like MI, 1+ everything gives us a very nice perfomance too. The A14 chip is just a tag line to sell the phone. Are we really going to process million instructions per second on a mobile phone? Defenitely not.Battery, After charging it to 100% in the morning, I am hardly getting 1 full day with average use. My battery is almost 20% at the end of the day with a screentime of 4-4.3 hours[Update : With low power mode, it makes a 6 hour day, ending with 30%]. Camera quality is amazing in natural light. Yes, as specified it works so nice in night light, but please dont mistake night light as no-light. Front camera is still average. The same things i see in every other mid range android phones. I am still using JIO 4g. Not sure how this would work on 5g (must drain even faster)Face detenction, the color of the phone, Water resistant and all stuffs are nice to have, fancy items.  But not really convinced if this is all we get for 84k?Fast charging - I bought a 20W charger from apple store for Rs.1900. I plug in when the battery is 20-25% and it takes 1.45 hours to reach 100%. If this is all about fast charging you are looking for, well and good. I never tried with magsafe, honestly. But this to me doesnt seem fast charging for 2800~ mah battery.I wont say that this phone is too poor. It gives us all that it promises. Personally I dont recommend investing 85k Indian money into this. Either go for lower versions of other iphones like 11 or you can wait for an year and buy this at cheaper cost.PROS : Camera & PerfomanceCONS : Battery and Cost

44,Somehow Returned this,"I got this product on 20th April 2022 and returned it on 28th April 2022 haha, with so much excitement I opened the product and started using it, since I was an Android to iOS user I did find some difficulties in using it but it was fine. The real problem started while using it,The Phone started to overheat for minimal usages, I'd call for 5 to 10 minutes hands would be burning with phone heat, 15 minutes of social media again hands would be burning hot, I didn't get any temperature warning but heat was hot enuf for me to keep it aside for a long period of time, Due to overheat the battery used to die fast and I would hv required to charge it thrice a day. I roamed around the Apple authorized service centres and so many calls to Amazon for a replacement but nobody seems to give me any solution, then I thought I'll just use it, but again it started getting worse and I called Apple and they said to give my phone to service centre for 7 to 10 days so they can diagnosis be done and find out issue while I survive 7 to 10 days without a phone haha, then I couldn't take it anymore as I understood if I continue using this phone I wouldn't get 4 weeks yet alone 4 years and pleaded to Amazon coz I am a prime member ever since prime was out and I have ordered tons and tons of products in Amazon and never faced this issue.But the hard earned money going like this was hurting so I submitted whatever documents Amazon asked me to get from Apple and finally they gave me return for this product.The item has been returned and get to reach their warehouse which then oly I will get my refund initiated which is gonna take another 15 to 20 days, but I'm fine since I can wait and not lose my hard earned money. For now I hv a 7 year old phone as backup which is working ok ok but I can manage to write atleast this review.So whoever face this issue, and wants a replacement or return please try your best with whatever Amazon asks from you n they will provide a solution.I still need to buy an Apple phone next coz I bought the 2k adapter and it's return period got over haha.Anyways the Phone was amazing to use,So performance wise 5/5Camera was just amazing 5/5Battery tho 1 or 2/5Over heating so -2/5 or 0/5Overall a bad experience but still excited to get apple product.Btw Apple service centres help very well and listen to ur problems and provide solutions properly and handles it well.So if you are getting a iPhone I hope u guys don't face any situation like mine.Thank you n have  a great day :)

76,Just Wow....,"I have been using iPhone SE 2020 since last year which has been a great experience for me. Now that I bought IPhone 12 it is also a great phone with so many features. But the best thing I have experienced is the camera quality. It is way much better than any other phone at this rate. I bought this phone in Great Indian Sale and bought only for 47 K which is also been a benefit for me. It's build quality is good and it is light weighted, lighter than Iphone SE 2020. The processor is fast but the battery back up is not up to the mark. It goes from 100 to 20 in a day use and I am not using it much so the battery is not that good. I also have to buy the 20w charger and it is really charging fast. When you are holding the phone it will make you feel premium. The phone hasn't lag since one month use. It will regularly get updates which is great. Other than battery backup there is nothing you will regret about the phone. Overall an iphone is and iphone. At least you will look rich.

78,This is a very good phone.  The seller is reliable.,"iPhone 12 is a good product. If you are not obsessed with the ‚Äòlatest and the best‚Äô type of phone, go for any apple phone on the list. I chose 12 because it is 5 G compliant.  If you are a price watcher, this is perhaps the best time to buy this one. I bought my phone earlier this month, and the price has dropped by  one thousand rupees since then! But I am happy with the phone. Apple phones are expensive, but once you use an iPhone, you may not wish to use any other phone. I have been using a 5S for ten years. Only recently I changed the battery. It still looks good and works fine. You may take a couple of days to get used to the new device. 128 prices have dropped, 64 prices have remained almost the same since early October. This seller is good. Initially I was a bit unsure about buying it online, but if you live in a small city even buying from an apple store is almost like online buying. Go for it. Too early to comment on battery life. For  best results, keep your iPhone phone on low battery mode, except while charging.

83,Long Term Review: Excellent All Rounder Device,"This is going to be a long review, sit back, relax and have a read.I bought the iPhone 12 in May of 2021 after selling my OnePlus.Having used the iPhone7 and XR for years, this was my third iPhone.I have to say the iOS experience on the XR was absolutely horrible. Terrible reception, average battery and mediocre cameras forced me to move to android. I was tempted to move the 12 for all the improvements in modems, screen and the camera.And boy was I surprised . Let‚Äôs take up the review in sections.1. Screen: Having used a high refresh rate screen of OP8 before, I was quite sceptical about the 60hz of iPhone12 before I bought it. But, astonishingly, the iPhone12 screen is buttery smooth, courtesy of the high touch sampling rate and excellent animations. This does not feel like a 60hz display, and I cannot stress this enough. The display is EXCELLENT .2. Camera: being a photographer who has spent half of his life travelling, I prioritise a good camera over anything else. And these are surely the most spectacular cameras that I have used on a smartphone. Excellent HDR, great details and very post processing friendly. Of course, the video is as good as it gets on a phone. Attaching some images I shot on the 12 for your reference. Trust me when I say this, you could use this for some semi professional shoot just fine, if it‚Äôs only for social media and you are not printing really big.3. Battery: Battery on this device is not spectacular, it‚Äôs average. It will get you through the day for sure, unless you are in very long video calls two three times a day. It is good enough, on par with my OnePlus.4. Build Quality: this is where it is head and shoulders above the competition. Rock solid, an led weirdly lightweight, this feels very, very premium.5. Software: iOS 14 and the iOS15 have really pushed the sub par experience of ios11 away, and this software now feels smoother than ever. Great improvements. Excellent software experience, not something I could say with my XR.Summary: Excellent device, with no complains. This could really be one of the first devices that I used which I can call perfect. Highly recommended.

It gets warm sometimes. Charging speed is fine. I wont recommend it for gaming.iPhones are on the pricier side but I am expecting long term use with the same snappier feel and less bugs.

86,Phone is great but iOS sucks,"First of all, I don't know why people here are leaving misleading reviews, I didn't feel any sort of heating issue or something like that, neither my phone is damaged nor it is refurbished. These sort of reviews are only making other people sceptical.Now let's talk about the cell phone itself.It is great, I love it. The reason why I gave 3 stars is because I have been an android user before this device and I am being honest right now :-iOS sucks in terms of user experience, Android is easy to use and makes a lot of sense (believe me, I was a hardcore android user, I didn't only use it for playing games and making calls). In iOS I kinda feel like being constraint.let me give you few example, which are quite obvious but still not in iOS:-1. Notifications- You can't reply through notifications.- Notifications from a similar user/ sender do bundle, but you can only see the latest message (You can't just swipe down on notification to preview the messages)- if you want to remove a particular notification then you have to swipe two times to the left. If you swiped right then it will open the message for you (lol).- Notifications are so huge, sometimes it's really painful to scroll through all the notifications.2. App library- It has something called app library, they thought it'd be cool to make one but by giving their own flavor. They bundled things in their respective folder not like in android where each icon represent an app. You have to explicitly click on search(app library) to see all apps in the list view or to search an app. Just copy android, no one is slapping you in the face for that.3. whatsapp- Using whatsapp is really frustating sometimes.- To send some media to a contact, there are three processes. Two times it will do preparing and then one time it will do the sending (finally). if you are sending some big media to someone then you can literally get a 15 min power nap and then grab a cup of coffee and drink it, still there might be chances that the iOS would be in one of the preparing process.- Sometimes when you click on someone's profile then instead of opening the user's profile, whatsapp tends to scroll to the location from where that current day chats are starting (I think that is whatsapp's issue not iOS)- You can't directly send any media as a document (preserving it's quality). There are steps to do that too.The above points are few examples, I will keep updating them as per my experience.I am not saying iOS is slow or the phone's hardware is bad, it's actually quite opposite of bad, it's fast and amazing.I just hated the user experience domain of iOS. It really really sucks. iOS should bluntly copy the android things so that the HARDCORE IPHONE USERS will know what user experience they were missing.

92,Absolutely loved the phone but price could have been bit cheaper,"I phone i must say having great optimization of software with hardware, more quality apps are available when compared to google, receiving a file is the only major pain i felt till now,Battery backup is really good 2800 mAh in apple is almost like 5000mAh in android am not kidding, i have rog phone 3 it is 6000 mAh but at the end of the day the i phone has almost same % left, may be it's due to the less hz display.Despite of having 60Hz display it feels goodAnd what can i say the speakers are loud and clear compared with rog 3.45k should have been the right price for 64gb model but for 53k it's not a bad deal either, if you ask me spending 50k for an android is not worth since i phone has all hardware and software superiority.No charger is a big let down by apple. And finally 64gb is good enough if you ask me as most of those having wifi connection can easily upgrade to i cloud paying just 75rs/Month and for the average 3 years of use the price will be still 2700rs in three year. For the 128gb i had to pay 8000rs more so still i am saving around 5300rs if i chose to use i cloud from the starting day.No Finger print sensor , but it's ok the face id does it right but yes the finger print should be good. And for the notch it's ok. I phone 12 and 13 has virtually no difference so y to waste 20k more money buying the 13 just for the bit improvement of camera and brightness, hope you like my review üôÇ

96,Best Iphone,"Phones been amazingI have used iphone 4s , 5 , 6s and xr but I liked it.Long battery life, not quite as good as iPhone 13 but Close. Plus I didn‚Äôt like the weight and thickness of iPhone 13  just to get maybe 45-60 minutes more time at the most. I don‚Äôt see any difference in speed between Bionic14 and Bionic 15 what so ever. And to much hype for the 120 h refresh rate, no noticeable difference at all. Also I actually think iPhone 12 pictures look better than iPhone 13 because by supposedly having slight bit more detail they over saturate the black in them. Love the thin weightless feel in iPhone 12 and have had zero issues. I‚Äôm keeping this phone till the wheels fall off. Great value.

98,If you get iphone 12 for around 42000 then go for it.,"I purchased iphone 12 in great Indian festival sale for 41500 excluding charger.

Got ios update16.1 . Build quality feels premium. (In hand use without back cover feels so good that i cannot explain). Iphone 12 is slightly lighter in weight.I even played apex legends and fps was constant, no lag,no heating issue. Hdr content is top notch. Plus it's 5g so I can easily use it for more than 5yrs.Overall after using iphone 12 for around 2months i can say it is worth it. Overall experience 5/5

101,How to decide between iPhone 11 and 12,"After thinking a lot, I decided to go ahead with iPhone 12. The original price is ‚Çπ 84900. After credit card discount(‚Çπ6000), old phone exchange(‚Çπ3450) and reward points money(‚Çπ4530) inclusion, I bought it for ‚Çπ70920. There‚Äôs also an additional 3000 discount on red and white variants but I couldn‚Äôt let go of blue1. PRICE: Considering iPhone 11 would be supported by iOS for 4 years, based on the current price it‚Äôd cost 13k per year and iPhone 12 for 5 years would cost 14.9k(excluding exchange discount) per year. For me price gap for both phones didn‚Äôt seem to make a huge difference as IPhone 11 is already an year old and costing only a 2k less per year.2: DISPLAY: I‚Äôve purchased iPhone 11 for my mom last year and been observing the display for some months. Compared to iPhone 11, the iPhone 12 display is far superior and has better pixel quality.3: BEZELS: the bezels of iPhone 12 are much thinner and makes the phone look decent unlike in 11. Apart from this, the phone is incredibly light making it easy to hold it.How to choose between 64/128gb:If you‚Äôre not really tight on budget, I‚Äôd suggest to go for 128gb variant. I‚Äôve been using one plus for 1.5 years and storage  occupied about 60gb. So it‚Äôd make good sense to check your current phone usage. Either way you can also opt for iCloud 50gb storage which would cost approximately the difference amount of 64 and 128 go for 5 years.CONS:1. Could have definitely included the charger for the price2. If you‚Äôre an android user, migration would be little time consumingUpdate: I‚Äôve uploaded a couple of pictures shot using automatic night mode. :)

106,An overpriced Average product,"I wanted to explore how good is Apple compared to Android. I must say the only good thing about this is consistency in both cameras and various different lightings. However on a number of occasions it does make you look darker than what ever you are. I find more cons tha pros so here is a list1. Network connectivity and wifi is not upto the mark. My OnePlus 9 pro will have better coverage with same wifi and network.2. At this exorbitant price, it's painful to see 60hz screen. You would find the scrolling painfully slow.3. Every accessory is expensive and the quality of these accesories is not something out of the world.4. The charging speed is really slow. Some claim fast chargers ruin the battery. But i had OnePlus phones easily lasting 3 plus of battery with fast charge. Have seen couple of iPhones draining battery within 2 years. My friends have iPhone 11 which i am referring to.5. Lack of customisation and the same boring look of the icons and you need to search numerous things to share anything.6. Face ID gets annoying at times. You need to also have other ways like fingerprint apart from passcode to unlock when u want to answer video calls.7. The nasty notch. I dont know if apple needs another decade to remove this. The new series pill shape is not either the best looking.8. Lock into the ecosystem and lack of flexibility.

Initially, I was worried because of the battery life. Because on paper it is just a 2815 mAh battery.

178,I miss my OnePlus 6,"Android v/s iOSPro Apple1. Tons of privacy features and solid implementation. Every new app installed needs permission to send notifications.And with a future update, facebook won't be able to track what you're doing in other apps outside of Facebook. This deserves an applaud. 2. BatteryThe battery is amazing, giving more than 6 hours of screen on time. OnePlus can't touch this. If you bring this up with them, they'll distract you by saying it has fast charging.3. Camera - photos are ok and decent BUT, DAMN, the video quality is amazing. Totally stabilized ready for uploads.4. Build Quality - SOLID.5. Continued updates for years and years. An android may last you 2-4 years, and the updated would be ""raam bharose"", but these new iphones especially will easily last 5 years minimum with no compromises on software and security upgrades.6. Less features, but they work 10/10. Example, auto fill OTP option in keyboard works every single timein iPhone. In Android, if your keyboard is open already before the otp arrives, then this feature won't work. Half baked implementation.Pro Android / Anti - iOS1. Notifications. Notifications centre on iPhone SUCKS. I have missed email notifications regularly. Android does this so well.2. Implementation of new app library feature sucks. This creates a very confusing situation. The way to solve this would be if the auto-folders in app library could be manually managed.3. Screen Sizes and Notch - The Notch is a disgrace for iphones when the iphones have reached the level of punch hole displays. Hoping the next year's model can make it better.4. No Truecaller in iPhone and no call recording. I can forgive the call recording considering the privacy first model, but truecaller is a pro to privacy.5. CHEAP QUALITY OF CHARGING CABLE. For a luxury brand, this is a disgrace.6. PRICE - Yes, iphones are expensive BUT, paying +10-15k for a phone available cheaper in Dubai / USA really pinches. Damn Taxes.7. Yes iPhones run smoothly but don't think that these don't stutter. I face very light stutters now and then and I restart at least once a week whenever I encounter it.I'll probably give this phone to my family member against their iPhone x since they're way too deep in ios ecosystem now.

¬†Got this for a friend on the amazon sale for 46.5k. This is the lowest price this model has ever gone down to, so I was a bit skeptical in the beginning(hoping it was not a pile of rocks or a used product). The phone reached on time as promised and was packed well and the box felt solid. The build quality is really good and everything seems to be working fine on switching it on and testing it. If you are in the apple ecosystem, then you will enjoy this phone. But me personally, I appreciate my oneplus 9 pro much more after experiencing the iphone 12 for a while.

229,"READ before BUY ! ""Iphone 12! Worth buying or not?""","From owner POV, It's completely different experience for me as I've come from a long line of android platform. But the UI is very attractive. I think it surpassed my expectations as a consumer. But as a rational thinker, 79k is a lot for a phone which carry a little amount of specs ships. I'm lucky that I have a Amazon business account, so getting a GST bill.As per the limitations :1. 60 Hz display (with the beautiful UI animations, it doesn't feel like one)2. Google exceeds on Maps, contacts and AI capabilities.3. Hefty price tag. (I mean! Wtf is this! 80k! Are you serious?)4. Necessity of a 1900 INR charger (That too of 20W and without extra cable. Why?)5. One sillicon case worth 4600 INR ( Sorry! My name's not Sanjib 'Ambani' ! Terrible joke! I know! I left my sarcasm capabilities at an Apple store for leverage.)Advantages:1. It's a flagship iPhone 12 with A14 bionic processor and it's best in the market.2. The UI and the optimization (And I came from an Android background.)3. Display (Can't find much difference if you're a Samsung flagship user.)4. The design and in-hand feel.5. The build quality, you can feel by holding it that it's premium.Overall, I found it very attractive and worthy of the money spent. (Because I am telling my mind this only as justification for a 80k expenditure)On a serious note, as coming from an Android background, if Samsung could launch a flagship with Snapdragon latest processor, I could think of buying that.But iPhone 12 in 2020?  its a technological wonder. It's very slim, premium and beautiful.If you're comfortable to spend 80k, you should go for it for a wonderful experience.
